## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```sh
brew install mpecan/tokf/tokf
```

### cargo

```sh
cargo install tokf
```

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mpecan/tokf
cd tokf
cargo build --release
# binary at target/release/tokf
```

---

## How it works

```
tokf run git push origin main
```

tokf looks up a filter for `git push`, runs the command, and applies the filter. The filter logic lives in plain TOML files — no recompilation required. Anyone can author, share, or override a filter.

---

## Usage

### Run a command with filtering

```sh
tokf run git push origin main
tokf run cargo test
tokf run docker build .
```

### Test a filter against a fixture

```sh
tokf test filters/git/push.toml tests/fixtures/git_push_success.txt --exit-code 0
```

### Verify filter test suites

```sh
tokf verify                    # run all test suites
tokf verify git/push           # run a specific suite
tokf verify --list             # list available suites and case counts
tokf verify --json             # output results as JSON
tokf verify --require-all      # fail if any filter has no test suite
tokf verify --list --require-all  # show coverage per filter
tokf verify --scope project    # only project-local filters (.tokf/filters/)
tokf verify --scope global     # only user-level filters (~/.config/tokf/filters/)
tokf verify --scope stdlib     # only built-in stdlib (filters/ in CWD)
```

### Explore available filters

```sh
tokf ls                    # list all filters
tokf which "cargo test"    # which filter would match
tokf show git/push         # print the TOML source
```

### Customize a built-in filter

```sh
tokf eject cargo/build            # copy to .tokf/filters/ (project-local)
tokf eject cargo/build --global   # copy to ~/.config/tokf/filters/ (user-level)
```

This copies the filter TOML and its test suite to your config directory, where it shadows the built-in. Edit the ejected copy freely — tokf's priority system ensures your version is used instead of the original.

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--timing` | Print how long filtering took |
| `--verbose` | Show which filter was matched (also explains skipped rewrites) |
| `--no-filter` | Pass output through without filtering |
| `--no-cache` | Bypass the filter discovery cache |
| `--no-mask-exit-code` | Disable exit-code masking. By default tokf exits 0 and prepends `Error: Exit code N` on failure |
| `--baseline-pipe` | Pipe command for fair baseline accounting (injected by rewrite) |
| `--prefer-less` | Compare filtered vs piped output and use whichever is smaller (requires `--baseline-pipe`) |
